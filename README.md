## Hi there 👋

I'm **Octavien Requier**, an engineering student at **ENSICAEN**, currently in my 2nd year of the **Génie Physique et Systèmes Embarqués (GPSE)** program.  
I’m working in **alternance at the GREYC laboratory (eV-Technologies team)**, where I contribute to **IoT systems development** and **ultra-sensitive magnetic sensor acquisition platforms**.

My focus lies at the intersection of **embedded electronics**, **signal processing**, and **scientific instrumentation** — turning theory into experimental results.
